1.0.1

* 0.9.15 renamed 1.0.1

0.9.15

* calling schedconfig based on wmsqueue, and batchqueue is got from schedconfig['nickname']
* no rc_msg when pilot returns rc != 0
* using ...all.json instead of ...pilot.json for schedconfig URL
* removed self.grid
* calling the monitor in wrapper.py needs to be done after setting the Logger
* aborting if undefined env vars needed to call the web monitor
* extracting real value of wndir in cases like USCD where $OSG_WN_TMP is itself an environment variable
* using $TMP for pilot input option -d when $OSG_WN_TMP is empty string, 'none' or 'null'
* input options --wrappervo and --wrappergrid eliminated
* in the case of ATLAS, converting RC=65 to RC=0
* not running post_run( ) if run( ) failed, so we can return an non-zero RC
* making use of pilotsource.py classes to get the pilot tarball
* calling method _untar( ) from within PilotCodeSource( ) class
* calling _cvmfs() from validations.py instead of plugin class method
* implemented methods _presetup( ) and _postsetup( )
* implemented generic method _readschedconfig( )
* root logger named "wrapper" instead of "main"
* option --wapperpilotcodeurl removed
* added option --wrapperpilotcoderatio
* calling monitor from wrapper.py
* removed input option --wrappermode
* removed input option --wrapperpurpose
* complete new code to deal with pilot code, allowing for the new wrapper input options and formats
* code to call monitor implemented in python

0.9.14

* method _setupWN() split into 2 methods: _setupWN() and _setupatlas()
* source() back to be a class instead of a function, at least for now
* added check for cvmfs
* entire refactoring of plugins. 
  New ones created: atlas.py and atlasosg.py. 
  Old one base.py simplified.
  Removed string "plugin" from filenames
  Directory wrapperplugins/ renamed plugins/
* printing the new sys.path after each source
* bug fixed when -s <wmsqueue> was passed to a variable meant to just be a path, not a command
* raising exceptions when the setup.sh file does not exist
* new WrapperException classes created
* function source() now returns the RC of the sourcing command and the output of that command.
* minor code refactoring

0.9.13

* not sourcing cctools setup.sh file
* download schedconfig from new URL, in JSON format
* added check for cvmfs

0.9.12 

* added explanatory msg to the RC log message in run() method for atlasprodpilotplugin.py
* if-else implemented in atlasprodpilotplugin.py and atlasprodpilottestplugin.py
  just in case ifconfig is not available. 
* pre_run() in TrivialPlugin returns an RC
* the lookup table removed
* added 2 variables for wrapper tarball checksum (to be ignored) and pilotcode tarball checksum

0.9.11  (skipping version 0.9.10)

* passing wmsqueue as input option -s to local/setup.sh

0.9.9

* Fix bug in source() to return both output of setup command and new environment,
  and not only the environment.
* passing same pilot args to the arbitrary script in atlasprodpilottestplugin.py
  as done for pilot code in atlasprodpilotplugin.py

0.9.8

* new plugin atlasprodpilottestplugin to run arbitrary plugin scripts.
  A new entry in the lookup table to use this new testing plugin, with PURPOSE=TEST
  The previous label PURPOSE=TESTING moved to PURPOSE=TESTPILOT
* returning the output of __call__() method in class source.
  Printing that output after calls to source() at DEBUG level.
* Better log messages when trying curl command. 
  Also some messages move from info -> warning and from error -> critical.
* Checking every step in method execute() in base.py

0.9.7

* Loop within method _schedconfigsetup() in plugin atlasprodpilotplugin
  to try the curl command 3 times in case of failure.
  Aborting wrapper with the 3 attempts failed. 

0.9.6

* source() is a class instead of a function, using class SysPath
* improved FORMAT for log messages.
* plugin atlasprodpilot does not search for python binaries.
* plugin atlasprodpilot adds -h and -s inputs to the pilot, if not done at the command line.
* plugin atlasprodpilot captures RC from pilot.runMain()
  wrapper.py captures the RC from the plugin, and sys.exit(RC) 
* some env vars are not meant to change in source(), so their value is not overriden.
* in wrapperutils.py, after sourcing a setup file and updating the os.environ[],
  we recreate sys.path because env var PYTHONPATH is not re-read once the 
  python interpreter has been launched. 
* plugin atlasprodpilot adds -d as value of $OSG_WN_TMP or $TMP, if not done at the command line.
* allowing getting the pilotcode tarball from disk, not only URL
* added some debug info on the tarball download task

-- This CHANGELOG file was created on 2013-06-05, 
   where version of wrapper.py on the trunk was "0.9.6"
